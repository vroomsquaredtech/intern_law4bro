client under undue influence? Bro, law has your back. It is the domination of free will of an acquaintance for medical procedures or, for purpose of obtaining any unfair advantage.

The Act 6 of 1899  added to the Law in the existence for undue influence.

Under the new Law the onus of proof is placed on the person in the dominating position. The proof by the dominating person must satisfy two things. Firstly, that nature of the transaction is conscientious  and secondly, that there is no unjust enrichment.

The new Law also clarifies the stand in specific cases of parental influence, patient vulnerability, financial institutions and banks, so check them out.

Finally, The court might set aside completely or partly the terms and conditions of the contract. Follow Law4Bro for more such content.
